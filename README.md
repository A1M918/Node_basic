This project includes basic structure of a back-end which includes JsonWebToken Authentication, Logging, and jwt-express as middleware which allow\block public\protected requests. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

1. Git
2. Node version 8+
3. NPM or yarn

## Let's start !

### 1- Clone repository
create a directory where you want to clone the project. Install and open ```git```  bash and enter following command: 

    git clone https://github.com/A1M918/Node_basic.git

### 2- Installing dependencies

with the opened ```git```bash window in last step, enter following command:
    
    cd Node_basic 
then 

    npm i

### Running the project
I've added ```nodemon``` as dev-dependency and added command ```npx nodemon ./index.js``` into ```package.json```'s script section. so you can either run ```npm start``` for normal run and/or you can ```npm run dev``` which will run the project with ```nodemon```.
